1: Headline: My project uses artificial intelligence to reduce waiting time in networks.

2: Intro. Talk about what caches are. Past user behaviour -> predictions -> cache make-up.

3: Prev. Research: Small, skewed data set. Concluded that PPAs were too volatile to be used.

4: Problem. algorithms, PardusStats, PardusEnsemble, PardusFS.

5: Hypothesis. They will perform better.

6: Explain three of the algorithms. Rush, rush, rush.

7: PardusStats - abstracts away data parsing and handling. Reduces 1000's of LOC to 35.

8: Talk about results. First, explain the graph, what it does.
